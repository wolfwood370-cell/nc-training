/**
 * src/types/movement.ts
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Clinical domain model for the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and
 * pain-tracking subsystem ("Red Flags") used by the Coach's on-floor
 * assessment workflow.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * The FMS (Cook, Burton, Hoogenboom — 2006) is a 7-test screen that scores
 * fundamental movement patterns on an ordinal 0–3 scale, plus 3 binary
 * "clearing tests" that gate certain patterns by the presence of provocative
 * pain. The composite score is the sum of the seven movement-pattern
 * scores (max 21).
 *
 * Two clinical rules govern composite scoring and are encoded here:
 *
 *   1. ASYMMETRY RULE — for any test scored bilaterally (Hurdle Step,
 *      Inline Lunge, Shoulder Mobility, ASLR, Rotary Stability), the
 *      pattern's contribution to the composite is the LOWER of the two
 *      sides. The asymmetry itself (delta L vs R) is preserved as raw
 *      data because it is independently predictive of injury risk.
 *
 *   2. CLEARING-TEST OVERRIDE — if a clearing test elicits pain, the
 *      gated pattern's score becomes 0 regardless of the raw movement
 *      score. The mappings are:
 *         Shoulder Mobility ── gated by ── Shoulder Impingement Clearing
 *         Trunk Stability   ── gated by ── Spinal Extension Clearing
 *         Rotary Stability  ── gated by ── Spinal Flexion Clearing
 *
 * NOTE on schema coexistence
 * --------------------------
 * The legacy `fms_tests` table (flat-column, see migration
 * 20260110093015) is still consumed by alerting hooks (`useFmsAlerts`,
 * `useAthleteHealthProfile`). This file introduces the richer
 * `FmsAssessment` document model that will back the new
 * `fms_assessments` table — both can coexist while we migrate.
