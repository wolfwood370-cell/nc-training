// Strongly-typed contracts for the `profiles.settings` JSONB column.
//
// Why a separate file:
//   - Supabase generates `settings: Json` (free-form) in types.ts. That
//     forces every consumer to do `as any` / `as unknown as` casts, which
//     defeats type-checking and was flagged in the coach audit as C2.
//   - Keeping the shape here (instead of in types.ts) means it survives
//     `supabase gen types` regenerations without merge conflicts.
//
// Convention: every field is optional and nullable. The DB schema makes
// no individual-key guarantees on the JSONB blob — only the column-level
// "this is some JSON" — so consumers must defend with `??` defaults.
